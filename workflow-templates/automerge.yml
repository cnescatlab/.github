# It automatically merges a pull request when:
#   * the required number of review approvals has been given (see repo settings)
#   * the required checks have passed (see repo settings)
#   * the pull request is up to date (see repo settings)

# How to use this workflow
# ========================

# 2. Set the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable of the action
# pascalgn/automerge-action, it must be a Personal Access Token with
# write permission to the repo for workflows triggered on push to be
# executed when the pull request is merged.
# See https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token
